***
Category Stats Pivot Table note: The first column on our homework example is labeled Count of Outcome Row Labels and the 2nd column is Column Labels successful/failed/canceled/live.
***
When I created mine in Excel the 1st column header populates Count of state/Category and the 2nd column is State successful/live/failed/canceled
The info populated in the first column is the same on both example and my hw, but the header description is different. 
***
Additionally, the header for column 2 is also labeled differently between my hw and the example. While the info is the same in both my hw and the example, the column categories are in a different order.
